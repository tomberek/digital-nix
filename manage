# A NixOps Wrapper for Git Projects
# ---------------------------------
#
# Repo: https://github.com/grafted-in/nixops-manager
#
# This tool is a simple wrapper around NixOps. The goal is to make it easier to use NixOps when you
# want to share your deployment state between members of a team.
#
# To achieve this, this wrapper gives every deployment as a separate state file which is placed
# in the same directory as this script. The files have the `.nixops` extension.
#
# You are expected to keep these files in version control. It's also *highly* recommended that you
# use a tool like git-crypt to keep them encrypted with this entry in .gitattributes:
#
#    *.nixops   binary filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
#
# This tool also enforces a per-repository version of Nixpkgs via a `nixpkgs-version.sh` file in the
# same directory as the script. This ensures that all users have a consistent version of NixOps and
# deploy a consistent set of packages to servers.
#
# Most commands work identically to NixOps. However, instead of specifying deployments with
# the `--deployment/-d` flag, you select a deployment in the first argument. In other words, instead
# of the normal NixOps usage of
#
#   nixops deploy -d stage --check  # Normal nixops usage.
#
# You'd run:
#
#   ./manage stage deploy --check   # Manage script usage.
#
# This assume there is a file ./stage.nixops where this state is being stored.
#
# Use `./manage --help` to see normal NixOps help.
# Use `./manage {deployment} .shell` to open a Nix shell where the environment is set up to use
# `nixops` directly with the same behavior as running `./manage` commands.
